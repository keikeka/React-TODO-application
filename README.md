# React TODO application

> By Keili Rosales

## Objective

The main idea is to create a TODO list application that allows users to add and delete tasks (user cannot update tasks). Changes were applied according to the functionality, putting buttons to add and delete tasks, as well as customizing the TODO with Christmas theme.

## Application

1. Install the NPM packages (be sure to use the latest version of node): `npm install`.
2. Run the project using: `npm run start`.
It verifies that the component is working and you can add and remove tasks.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- ReactJS
- Javascript
- JS-Events

## Contributions
